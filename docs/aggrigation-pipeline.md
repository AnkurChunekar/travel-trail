## MongoDB aggregation pipeline:

- MongoDB aggregation pipeline is an extremely powerful and extremely useful MongoDB framework for data aggregation.
- The idea is that we basically define a pipeline that all documents from a certain collection go through where they are processed step by step in order to transform them into aggregated results.
- For example, we can use the aggregation pipeline in order to calculate `averages` or calculating `minimum` and `maximum` values or we can calculate distances, and we can really do all kinds of stuff. It's really amazing how powerful this aggregation pipeline is.
